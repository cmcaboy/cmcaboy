I'm the CTO at [Rapptr Labs](https://www.rapptrlabs.com) where I manage a group of 35 engineers. While I am not managing, I spend a lot of my time working with React, React Native, and GraphQL backends. I do a lot of [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/CoryMcAboy). If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out.
